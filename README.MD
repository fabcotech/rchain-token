### Rholang (RChain) token (v6.0.1)

Fungibles and non-fungibles tokens on the RChain blockchain.

This repo includes a CLI so you can very quickly start playing with rchain-token contract, and SDK that you can integrate in any javascript application. The code and architecture takes advantage of [rholang's](https://rchain.coop/) powerful model of computation, and state of the art OCAP (object capabilities) paradigm to manage authorizations.

![RChain token](https://i.ibb.co/qrnCwVp/rchaintoken.png)

Object capabilities is a safe, no-encryption and flexible way to express ownership, permissions or authorizations. See or read about object capabilities [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGX2I31OhBE), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnBbi6ifzdo) or [here](http://erights.org/elib/capability/ode/ode-capabilities.html).

### Use CLI

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and eventually update the values to connect to another RChain network than RChain testnet. You must also add your private key in `.env` file so it will not appear on the screen and command line history.

```
# Deploy a master contract, that handles both boxes and contracts
node cli deploy-master
```

##### non-fungible tokens

Non-fungibles (NFT) tokens are identified by an ID like "pikachu", "amazon" or "cat123". They are still represented by purses, all purses have `quantity: 1`, a NFT purse cannot be divided. Purse `"0"` is a special mint purse from which you can purchase, and give a `newId` of your choice (See `./tests-fungibles/index.js:L229`).

As the owner, be very careful to only give `quantity: 1` when you create purses (except for special purse `"0"`).

```
# the following steps assume you have already deployed a master contract

# deploy a box that can store FTs, NFTs and super keys
node cli deploy-box --box-id mybox

# deploy contract and save super key to box
node cli deploy --fungible false --contract-id "mynft"

# create a non-fungible "cat123" token (quantity is always 1 for non-fungibles)
node cli create-purse --quantity 1 --type "0" --new-id "cat123"

# after the deployed is processed you can check that your purse is created
node cli view
```

##### fungible tokens

Fungibles tokens are identified mainly by the type property, purses can have a quantity superior to one. For examples 100 gold tokens, 1000 shares that can be exchanged, or any ERC-20 tokens will be fungible. The IDs of purses are automatically incremented (0, 1, 2 etc.), they do not matter that much.

```
# the following steps assume you have already deployed a master contract and a box

# deploy contract and save super key to box
node cli deploy --fungible true --contract-id "mytoken"

# Create/mint a purse with 12 tokens "GOLD" using the admin/owner capability
node cli create-purse --quantity 12 --type "GOLD"

# In the same contract, you can create another purse with another type of tokens
node cli create-purse --quantity 24 --type "SILVER"

# after the deployed is processed you can check that your purse is created
node cli view
```

##### CLI

**View**

```
# Check the content of a box (super keys and purses)
node cli view-box
```

```
# Check contract's locked (true/false), and purses
node cli view
```

```
# Check a specific purse in a contract
node cli view --purse 0
```

**Purses/tokens operations**

```
# Send a purse from a box to another box
CLI NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
```

##### Methods/operations available

ro = Read only, it does not change the state of box or contract in any wey

The methods prefixed with `PUBLIC_` are accessible by any rholang execution, the others are only available for the owners of a box or super key (contract), following the OCAP paradigm.

###### Master

All methods are public

```
ro PUBLIC_READ_ALL_PURSES: (contractId: String) => String | Map(all purses encoded)
ro PUBLIC_READ_BOX: (boxId: String) => String | Map(box purses and config)
ro PUBLIC_READ_PURSES: ({ contractId: String, [purseIds]: Set(String) }) => Map(purses)
ro PUBLIC_READ_PURSES_DATA: ({ contractId: String, [purseIds]: Set(String) }) => Map(purses data)
ro PUBLIC_READ_CONFIG: (contractId: String) => String | Map(contract config)
PUBLIC_REGISTER_BOX: ({ boxId: String, publicKey: String }) => String | (true, box ocap object)
```

###### Box

A box (OCAP) is usually stored in a private channel like `@(*deployerId, "rchain-token-box", "MASTER_REGISTRY_URI", "BOX_ID")`, see `op_deploy_box.rho` for example.

All the methods on a box are private (owner of the box only).

```
ro READ: () => Properties of the purse (quantity, price, box, publicKey, type)
PUBLIC_REGISTER_CONTRACT: ({ contractId: string, fungible: Bool, fee: Nil | (String, int) }) => String | (true, super key ocap object)
UPDATE_PURSE_PRICE: ({ contractId: String, purseId: String, price: Nil | Int }) => String | (true, super key ocap object)
UPDATE_PURSE_DATA:  ({ contractId: String, purseId: String, data: any }) => String | (true, super key ocap object)
WITHDRAW:  ({ contractId: String, purseId: String, quantity: Int, toBoxId: String, merge: Bool }) => String | (true, Nil)
PURCHASE:  ({ contractId: String, purseId: String, quantity: Int, merge: Bool, newId: String | Nil, data: any, purseRevAddr: String, purseRevAddr: VaultAuthKey }) => String | (true, Nil)
```

###### Contract

The ownership of a contract is expressed by the ownership of a super key that is returned by `PUBLIC_REGISTER_CONTRACT` method. A contract's super key (OCAP) is usually stored in a private channel like `@(*deployerId, "rchain-token-contract", "MASTER_REGISTRY_URI", "CONTRACT_ID")`, see `op_deploy.rho` for example.

All the methods on a super key are private (deployer of the contract only).

```
LOCK: () => String | (true, Nil) // cannot CREATE_PURSES anymore after a contract is locked
CREATE_PURSES: see cli/createPurse.js
```

##### Using SDK

The SDK files are in `./src`, if you have rchain-token (`fabcotech/rchain-token`) as a dependency of your project, you should be able to use them very easily.

```
import {
  masterTerm,
} from "rchain-token";

const boxRegistryUri = 'aaa';
const rholangTerm = masterTerm({
  depth: 3,
  contractDepth: 2,
})
```

##### Compile rholang -> javascript (src/)

\_Generate all javascript source code in `src/` from rholang with `npm run generate`

##### Testing

Have a local rnode instance running with the following bonds and wallets file. And automatic propose every x seconds. The private keys used for deployments are in `tests/index.js`.

wallets.txt

```
0x3769b4e68650bdfc7b55375034be6ee52978a14f,1000000000000,0
0x7f847d40c3ec604fe3d4263bfdd04111eb9b4e32,1000000000000,0

```

Also have at least those 2 lines in your .env file

```
READ_ONLY_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:40403
VALIDATOR_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:40403
```

`npm run test:ft`
`npm run test:nft`

##### Stressing

Many stress tests exist, see `stress/stress_*` files, you might want to change the variables on the top of each file.

example:
`node stress/stress_createPurses.js`
